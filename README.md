# Design and Analysis of Full Adder   
In the rapidly expanding VLSI industry, transistor density is increasing at an alarming rate.
According to Moore’s law, transistor density will double every eighteen months. The
device’s area, delay, and power consumption will all grow as the number of transistors
increases. As a result, a solution is necessary to lower the space while increasing the
device’s performance. For the past few decades, CMOS technology has been utilised to
develop chips in the semiconductor industry, but as the number of transistors increases, so
does the area of the device and the delay. As a result, it is necessary to convert to a
technology that utilises less area and has a shorter delay. As a result, the Domino logic is
utilised to create the one-bit full adder, and the various performance parameters such as
area, delay, and power consumption in both technologies are compared
